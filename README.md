**Hey, I'm zorbyte :wave:**

I'm a young developer who for the most part, just likes to mess around with code :stuck_out_tongue:<br>
At times, I do like to dive into a serious project and hopefully make something the world will find useful!

**:hammer_and_wrench: Technologies I like to use**
  -  :scroll: TypeScript/Javascript
  -  :sauropod: Deno
  -  :gear: Node.js
  -  ðŸ’¨ GoLang
  -  :atom_symbol: React 
  -  :electron: Electron
  -  :snake: Python
  

**:bulb: Hobbies/Interests**

  -  :computer: Programming and/or Computer Science (I guess this one makes sense, haha)
  -  :1234: Mathematics
